# Privacy Policy for MemoSnap

**Last Updated:** December 16, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. It is MemoSnap's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our application, MemoSnap, and other sites we own and operate.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Personal Data
**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.** MemoSnap is designed to be an offline-first application. 

### User Content
All content you create within MemoSnap, including:
- Notes and text
- To-do lists
- Photos and images imported into the canvas
- Canvas layouts and configurations

...is stored locally on your device (in the App's secure document directory). We do not have access to this data, and it is never uploaded to our servers.

## 2. Permissions and Access

To function correctly, MemoSnap may request access to certain features on your device. You can manage these permissions at any time in your device's Settings.

### Photo Library
- **Reason:** MemoSnap requests access to your photo library to allow you to:
  1. Import photos to place on your canvas.
  2. Save your created canvas designs (wallpapers) back to your device's Camera Roll.
- **Privacy:** We only access photos that you specifically select. We do not scan your library in the background.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
All your data is stored locally on your device. If you delete the MemoSnap app, your data (including all canvases and notes) will be permanently deleted from the device unless you have backed it up via iCloud Device Backup or iTunes.

### iCloud Backup
If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your local app data may be backed up to Apple's iCloud servers securely, governed by Apple's privacy policy.

## 4. In-App Purchases

MemoSnap offers a "Pro" version via In-App Purchase.
- **Transactions:** All financial transactions are handled directly by Apple via the App Store. We do not process, store, or have access to your credit card or banking information.
- **Purchase History:** We may have access to anonymous receipt data provided by Apple to verify your purchase status (e.g., whether you have unlocked the Pro features).

## 5. Third-Party Services

We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Mixpanel) or advertising networks that track you across apps.

## 6. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. As our app does not collect personal data, it is safe for users of all ages.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
